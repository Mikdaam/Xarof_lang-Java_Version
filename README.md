# `Xarof` Language Build Process

Since almost one year, i want to make a programming language for fun (actually to impress my friends ;). But the think is i don't have any knowlegde about building a programming language. Even i didn't not understand yet the concept of algorithm, the programming that i knew already like pointers in C language, stack, queue, hashtable implementations, etc. In conclusion, i was not ready yet for a long step. I decided then to learn all the algorithmics concepts and masterize 
pointers in C language.
After one year, i did not forget my project and decided to start the building of the programming even there are some concepts that i am not totally understand yet.
